				<h1>Welcome to BrandNUDL</h1>
				<p>BrandNUDL ('<span class="def">brand-noo&middot;dle</span>&nbsp;') is a front end web development laboratory concerned with the establishment of quirky and unique business ideas. Our mission is to work closely with you to produce layout and content that doesn't get lost in the digital jungle. Everything from logo design and taglines, to content and search engine optimization- we've got ya covered! If you can dream it, we can build it.</p>
				<br>
				<br>
				<p>BrandNUDL was concieved on a ramen-fuelled trip across SE Asia and born from a busted, old (but beautiful) third-hand laptop. Messy chunks of code and ugly sketches in dog-eared notebooks scraped together in airports, coffee shops and hostel kitchen floors across the world. 
				<br>
				<br>
				Simply put, we offer flexible and innovative design completely tailored to your requirements. We will help you to discover the face of your new business, or trim the fat and pin back the loose skin of your current one. And... we'll work <em>bloody</em> hard doing it!</p>

			<div class="process-cont">
				<div class="icon-container">
					<div class="process-bg"></div>
					<h4>1. Planning</h4>
					<p>In a lot of ways a great website and your favourite noodle-based meal are much alike. No planning in your site will most likely leave you feeling bloated, <span class ="fontplus">disgusting</span> and full of regret.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="icon-container">
					<div class="process-bg2"></div>
					<h4>2. Design</h4>
					<p>You need to ensure the elements of your site work together well, theme being an important concept in the process. Without <span class ="fontplus">slick</span> design, your site might not compliment your message.</p>
					
				</div>
				<div class="icon-container">
					<div class="process-bg3"></div>
					<h4>3. Development</h4>
					<p>Good things come to those who wait. If you want your site to be <span class ="fontplus">extra tasty</span> you need to let your ideas stew. Your site will require feedback throughout cooking, ensuring added flavour.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="icon-container">
					<div class="process-bg4"></div>
					<h4>4. Launch</h4>
					<p>Once you're happy with your brandNU website it'll be time to serve! You'll be able to <span class ="fontplus">enjoy every bite</span> of your site knowing each ingredient is fresh and fully customised to your taste.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="icon-container">
					<div class="process-bg5"></div>
					<h4>5. Maintainence</h4>
					<p>By this point you're probably feeling happy, full and sleepy. But... when you're <span class ="fontplus">hungry</span> for change or have a new recipe in mind - you now know your way around the kitchen. NUDL style!<p>

			<div class="about">
				<h1>A brief history...</h1>
				<p>The team at BrandNUDL come from a wide range of creative backgrounds and tie their skills together in the collaborative visual development of up-and-coming new businesses. Here in the lab we push you to get the best from your brainchild. <br><br> We first establish a <em>friendly voice</em> for your copy before creating <em>high quality illustrations</em> and photography for strong visual imagery. Finally we develop a unique, <em>hand-crafted website</em> (coded in a dark room by dedicated ramen-filled technicians), which is <em>sturdy, flexible and fully custom</em> to any requirements.</p><br>
				<br>
				<p>Our lab technicians are full of <span class ="fontplus">stupid ideas</span> and dark twisted thoughts. We encourage clients to come to us with their own crazy ideas so that we can think our way around any obstacle in the development process. If you haven't quite nailed down your idea, or are just toying with something- just drop us a line. Don't be shy! In any case, our friendly telephone operator is a <span class ="fontplus">really, really good listener.</span></p>

					<h4>FULLY CUSTOM DESIGN</h4>
					<p>We have a good time here in the lab, always accepting new challenges and trying to develop new ideas. While things are often unpredicatable in the initial stages we get consitantly solid results with almost zero explosions. We have a dedicated team of descientists (design scientists), who work tirelessly on the development of designer chemicals and algorithms which are fully unique to your design desires. It may sound like a mouthful... but you better believe it's a tasty one!</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<div class="exp exp2"></div>
					<h4>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN</h4>
					<p>If you've ended up in the lab it's usually because you are seeking something a bit different. While we can offer a massive range of templates and frameworks which will have your site looking snazzy, we also have a secret menu. All gloves are off in the <a href="#cta">danger zone</a> and BrandNUDL descientists aren't liable. We try to limit product testing on our animals and are actually developing something <span class ="fontplus">brown and spongey</span> to experiment on in the image of a minion. We live by the mantra "mind the gap" which doesn't really make any sense in this context.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<div class="exp exp3"></div>
					<h4>RESPONSIVE DESIGN</h4>
					<p>With the expansive growth of mobile devices and screens of all sizes now dominating the Earth, it is important that your beautiful new site is compatible across the range. All of the designs built here in the lab are fully responsive. This means that the site will change to suit the environment in which it's displayed, without compromising on the content. It's pretty technical stuff actually, trying to squeeze a website into a wristwatch. We'll make it work anywhere you like in all honestly, but, still argue that sundials are entirely underrated. </p>

					<h4>Andrea Lea Personal Trainer</h4>
					<p>Andrea wanted to put a fresh new twist on her old website. With a recent rise in client base and a blowing-up of her social media, she wanted a <em>stronger presence online</em> ...which the descientists in the lab were happy to help her achieve. <br><br>We built a clean interface with simple backgrounds that lead down a minimal, sleek layout. We were able to <span class ="fontplus">personalise</span> a theme of healthy eating and exercise around thematic illustrations and a colour scheme which compliments a friendly, green message. We were all really happy with <em><a href="https://brandnudl.github.io/andrea-lea-pt/" target="blank">the result</a></em>.</p>

					<h4>Scooby's Sweet Treats</h4>
					<p>We were in Cornwall last year at a <em>cattle auction</em> when we spotted Scooby selling sweets and treats from a hand-built wagon on the roadside. She was so friendly upon our approach that we offered to build her a website free of charge. There was a warm and friendly charm about her and we wanted to reflect that in the outcome. <br><br>The site was built around some interactive elements with <span class ="fontplus">wacky</span> positioning concepts and a conventional three column layout. Inventing a cutesy voice for the site copy was all part of the fun. We don't know if she'll ever get to see <em><a href="https://brandnudl.github.io/scoobys-sweet-treats/" target="blank">the finished product</a></em> because we forgot to get contact information from her.</p>

					<h4>Doodle Goose</h4>
					<p>Doodle Goose was actually the first site we had a crack at in the lab. Some of the layout ideas are very <span class ="fontplus">experimental</span> and the content is rooted in the presentation of her work. This site is the first case where we tried to build a narrative within the progression of background images. <br><br>The goose characters were fun to design and we were able to <em>tailor each design</em> to have a unique and personal touch to the client. Goose has a large social following so the contact section needed to stand out. We tested some SVG animation effects with nice results. Don't forget to <em><a href="https://brandnudl.github.io/doodle-goose/" target="blank">follow the goose!</a></em></p>

					<p>	&ldquo;I was really surprised at how solid these guys at BrandNUDL were. Gotta say, their methods are <span class ="fontplus">pretty unothodox</span> but the final result was wild!

					<p>&ldquo;I was actually built in a back room of the lab at BrandNUDL. I've been programmed to say good things about the work they do here. Even if I wanted to say something negative about the team I don't think it'd be possible. The last robot built here that tried to express an <span class ="fontplus">original thought</span> got dismantled.&rdquo;</p>
